# Jupyter notebooks 

## Why I created this repository?

Many times when I did some projects on the server, I need to
first set up an environment for that project, and usually, I 
used conda to do this. However, I encountered an unsolvable 
problem that massed me up. To overcome the problem, I decided
 to set up an environment in docker, and run it by singularity 
on the server. 

This is the first time I've ever tried. I hope it works.
